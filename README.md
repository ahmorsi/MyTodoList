# flux-shell

This is a very simple TodoList Web app based on ReactJs & Flux architecture. It can be considered as a tutorial for Flux design pattern and this implementation is inspired from [Facebook Flux Tutorial](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-todomvc)

# Usage

```bash
cd path/to/MyTodoList
npm install
npm run build
# open path/to/MyTodoList/index.html in your browser
```

# Watch

Instead of manually building after each change it's possible to automatically recompile the javascript bundle when files change:

```bash
npm run watch
# make javascript changes, then refresh path/to/MyTodoList/index.html
```
